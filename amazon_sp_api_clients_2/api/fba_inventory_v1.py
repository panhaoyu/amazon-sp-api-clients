        Returns a list of inventory summaries. The summaries returned depend on the presence or absence of the startDateTime and sellerSkus parameters:

        - When startDateTime is provided, the operation returns inventory summaries that have had changes after the date and time specified. The sellerSkus parameter is ignored.
        - When the sellerSkus parameter is provided, the operation returns inventory summaries for only the specified sellerSkus.
