        | Rate (requests per second) | Burst |
        | ---- | ---- |
        | .1 | 5 |

        Args:
            marketplace_ids: A list of marketplace identifiers. This specifies the marketplaces where the upload will be available. Only one marketplace can be specified.
            content_md5: An MD5 hash of the content to be submitted to the upload destination. This value is used to determine if the data has been corrupted or tampered with during transit.
            resource: The resource for the upload destination that you are creating. For example, if you are creating an upload destination for the createLegalDisclosure operation of the Messaging API, the {resource} would be /messaging/v1/orders/{amazonOrderId}/messages/legalDisclosure, and the entire path would be /uploads/2020-11-01/uploadDestinations/messaging/v1/orders/{amazonOrderId}/messages/legalDisclosure.
